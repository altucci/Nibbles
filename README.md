# Nibbles

This is the classic 2D Snake game.

Move the snake (with the arrow keys on the keyboard) to where the food is.
Each piece of food makes the snakes body grow longer and makes the snake's speed faster.
The objective is to have the snake eat as many pieces of food as possible witout dying.
The snake dies if it hits the outer bounds of the GUI window or if it hits its own tail.
